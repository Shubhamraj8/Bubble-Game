# 🫧 Bubble Game

A fun and simple **bubble-clicking game** made with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
You get a target number and need to click on the bubble that matches it before time runs out.  
It’s a quick, addictive little game that I built while learning JavaScript!

## 🎮 How to Play
1. A random **target number** appears at the top.  
2. Click on the bubble with that same number.  
3. Each correct click gives you **+1 point**.  
4. The timer runs for **60 seconds** — try to score as much as you can before it ends!
